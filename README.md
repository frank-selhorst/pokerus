# Pokemon Battle Simulator

=========

## Step 1.

Ask for name of "team1" and "team2"

## Step 2.

Select the generations for the pokemon selection

## Step 3.

Select how many pokemons per team (6=default)

## Step 4.

Before starting the simulator show both the teams selection of pokemons

## Step 5.

Give the option to give the full simulation report at once
Or to go through the simulation step by step.

## Ideas

Cool next project is to instead of run a simulation allow both teams to
take control over the battle.
